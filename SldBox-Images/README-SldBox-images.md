# SlideBox - Images

The Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope is designed so that each implementation of this system can be "branded" by the specific university (or other institution) that is hosting the Virtual Microscope.&nbsp; The "institution-specific" graphics for the generic ("Chipmunk") version of SlideBox are located in another GitHub directory ([SldBox-InstSpcImgChip](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/tree/main/SldBox-InstSpcImgChip)).&nbsp; However, in addition to these institution-specific graphics, the Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope also utilizes graphics (such as customized \"buttons\") that are used by all implementations of the Virtual Microscope.&nbsp; On the server, these shared graphics should be placed in a directory named \"images\" that is at the same level ("..\\images") as the directory containing the HTML & javascript files (see [SldBox-HTMLclient](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/tree/main/SldBox-HTMLclient)).

The SlideBox module of the Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope does not utilize customized \"buttons\" (unlike the Viewer, which does use custom \"buttons\").&nbsp; However, there currently are two graphics that are referenced by [SlideBox.htm](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/SlideBox.htm) in all implementations of SlideBox, and these two \*.png files are located in this GitHub directory ([SldBox-Images](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/tree/main/SldBox-Images)).&nbsp; These two shared \*.png files are left-over from when the Virtual Microscope was being rewritten to segregate all of the institution-specific references to a single institution-specific javascript file ([jrsbInSpcGlobal.js](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbInSpcGlobal.js)) and a separate institution-specific image directory ([SldBox-InstSpcImgChip](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/tree/main/SldBox-InstSpcImgChip)).&nbsp;  The two shared graphics (\*.png files) are no longer useful now that transitioning to version 4 is (more-or-less) complete, and the references to these image files will be removed in future versions of SlideBox.&nbsp;  Currently, however, these shared graphics in are still referenced by [SlideBox.htm](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/SlideBox.htm), so current implementations of SlideBox must still include this directory ([SldBox-Images](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/tree/main/SldBox-Images)) and its contents.

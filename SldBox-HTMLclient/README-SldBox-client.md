This directory ([SldBox-HTMLclient](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/tree/main/SldBox-HTMLclient)) contains SlideBox's HTML file ([SlideBox.htm](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/SlideBox.htm)) which runs in the user's internet browser.&nbsp; This directory also includes the cascading-style sheet file ([jrsbStyleMain.css](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbStyleMain.css), link in HTML file header) and the javascript files (listed at the end of HTML file body) that are invoked by the HTML file and run within the client's internet browser.&nbsp; The directory on the server that contains the files listed here should also contain SlideBox's PHP file ([SldBox-PHP/jrSB_GetSldLst.php](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-PHP/jrSB_GetSldLst.php)), which is invoked by [jrsbRegAjax.js](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbRegAjax.js) but runs on the server.

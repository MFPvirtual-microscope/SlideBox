# SlideBox - HTML, javascript, & CSS files

This directory ([SldBox-HTMLclient](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/tree/main/SldBox-HTMLclient)) contains SlideBox's HTML file ([SlideBox.htm](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/SlideBox.htm)) which runs in the user's internet browser.&nbsp; This directory also includes the cascading-style sheet file ([jrsbStyleMain.css](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbStyleMain.css), link in HTML file header) and the javascript files (listed at the end of HTML file body) that are invoked by the HTML file and that run within the client's internet browser.&nbsp; When it is running (loaded into the internet browser), SlideBox consists of two web \"pages\":

* the first \"page\", which is displayed when SlideBox loads, is involved in obtaining (from the user) the selection criteria that are used when searching the virtual slide database.&nbsp; [jrsbSelectInit.js](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbSelectInit.js) contains the javascript functions involved in initializing this \"page\" including building the criteria drop-down side-menus, [jrsbSelectAction.js](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbSelectAction.js) contains the javascript functions that handle user actions on this \"page\" including the display of the hierarchical drop-down side-menus for selection of criteria, and [jrsbMenu.js](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbMenu.js) contains the javascript functions that handle user actions on the main menu and \"information\" boxes accessed via the \"About\" menu (construction of the \"About\" menu is handled by jrsbSelectInit).  The actual Ajax call to the PHP file (on the server) is implemented in [jrsbRegAjax.js](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbRegAjax.js), although construction of the string passed to the PHP file and handling of the string returned from the server (PHP file) is done by javascript functions in [jrsbSelectAction.js](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbSelectAction.js).

* the second \"page\" is displayed when the user clicks the \"Get list of slides\" button on the first \"page\" (actually, when the javascript function selMakeItmArr() in jrsbSelectAction.js finishes processing the string returned by the PHP file).&nbsp; This page contains the list of slides meeting the criteria that the user chose on the first \"page\".&nbsp;  [jrsbList.js](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbList.js) contains the javascript functions that build this \"page\" and that handle user actions (including invoking the Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope's Viewer) on this \"page\".

The directory on the server that contains the files listed in this GitHub directory should also contain SlideBox's PHP file ([SldBox-PHP/jrSB_GetSldLst.php](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-PHP/jrSB_GetSldLst.php)), which is invoked by [jrsbRegAjax.js](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbRegAjax.js) but runs on the server.  See [SldBox-PHP](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/tree/main/SldBox-PHP).

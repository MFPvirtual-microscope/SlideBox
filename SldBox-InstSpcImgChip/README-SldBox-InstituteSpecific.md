# SlideBox - Institution-specific graphics

The Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope (including both the Viewer and Slidebox) uses images, such as university logos, and other information that are unique to, and involved in "branding", each specific implementation of the Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope.&nbsp; The files in this GitHub directory ([SldBox-InstSpcImgChip](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/tree/main/SldBox-InstSpcImgChip)) contain the "institution-specific" graphics for the generic ("Chipmunk") version of **SlideBox**.&nbsp; The number, names, and locations (on the server) of these images can be different for differnet implementations of the Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope (at different institutions); for SlideBox, the names and locations of these institution-specific graphics is specified in the javascript file [jrsbInSpcGlobal.js](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/blob/main/SldBox-HTMLclient/jrsbInSpcGlobal.js).

Since there is overlap between the images used by the Viewer and those used by SlideBox, the two modules that comprise the Multifocal-plane Virtual Microscope can share a common diirectory for their institution-specific graphics, although not all of these graphics are used by both modules.&nbsp; For clarity, this GitHub directory ([SldBox-InstSpcImgChip](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/SlideBox/tree/main/SldBox-InstSpcImgChip)) contain ONLY those institution-specific graphics that are required by the generic ("Chipmunk") version of **SlideBox**.&nbsp; The equivalent GitHub directory for the Viewer ([InstSpcImgChip](https://github.com/MFPvirtual-microscope/Viewer/tree/main/InstSpcImgChip)) contains the institution-specific graphics needed for the Virtual Microscope's **Viewer**.
